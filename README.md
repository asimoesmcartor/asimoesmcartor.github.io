# Development Branch

This branch is held to keep a record of my main production code that is used prior to the deploy. The master branch is currently the deploy branch. Thus, the gh-pages website shows my master branch deployed code (based off of the app from development branch code).

### In Development (may look bad/weird)

- Successfully split out Generative Lines app and imported it into React.

In progress:

- Creating Generative Stars app.
