### If you see this, that means I need to deploy!

# In Development (may look bad/weird)

In progress:

1. Splitting app into two seperate apps using branches -- vue-app-master and react-app-master
2. Creating new react-app-master to house react components to be able to easily render my generative projects as I see fit.
